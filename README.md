# parglm_torch

A Python package for performing multivariate General Linear Model (GLM) analysis with GPU acceleration. This package is designed to handle complex and real data, providing efficient computations for large datasets using PyTorch.

## Features
- Multivariate GLM analysis with permutation tests
- GPU and CPU support
- Handles complex-valued data
- Missing data handling (beta)
- Interaction modeling for experimental designs

## Installation

Set up PyTorch within your virtual environment.

Clone the repository and install the package using `setup.py`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdarmstr/parglm_torch.git
cd parglm_torch
pip install .
```
